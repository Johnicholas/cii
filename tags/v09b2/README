This hierarchy contains all the source code in the forthcoming book
`C Interfaces and Implementations' by David Hanson. For more information,
see World-Wide Web page at http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/cii/.

Contents
~~~~~~~~
The C Interfaces and Implementation (CII) distribution includes the
following files and directories.

README	this file.

CPYRIGHT
	copyright statement.

history.txt
	describes the distribution's revision history; an ASCII version
	of http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/cii/history.html.

src	source and header files for the CII library.

These directories hold the examples from the chapters indicated:

double	 1/Introduction
wf	 8/Tables
xref	 9/Sets
ids	15/Low-Level Strings
calc	18/Arbitrary Precision Arithmetic
mpcalc	19/Multiple Precision Arithmetic
sieve	20/Threads
sort	20/Threads
spin	20/Threads

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
To build and install libcii.a on a UNIX system, type

	cd src
	make CC="lcc -A" INCLUDEDIR=/cmnusr/local/include/cii LIBDIR=/usr/local/lib install

The assignments show the defaults. If you don't have lcc, use another
ANSI C compiler, e.g., CC=cc or CC=gcc. The other two assignments show
the default directories for the header files and for libcii.a; the
assignments can be omitted if you use the defaults.

There should be no errors or warnings, except for src/thread.c on some
systems. You should be able to gnore the warnings. src/thread.c
compiles only on SPARCs under SunOS 4.1.3 and on MIPSes under ULTRIX
V4.3 or IRIX 5.3.

"make clean" cleans up, but does not remove libcii.a; "make clobber"
cleans up and removes libcii.a.

The examples can be built by simply compiling them with compiler
options that specify the location of the header files and the library,
e.g., if libcii.a has been installed in /usr/local/lib, wf can be build
with the commands

	cd wf
	lcc -o wf -I/cmnusr/local/include/cii *.c -lcii

Some compilation systems accept a -L option to specify the location of
additional libraries, e.g.,

	cd sieve
	gcc -o sieve -I/cmnusr/local/include/cii *.c -L/usr/local/lib -lcii

Reporting Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Devise the shortest possible example program that elicits the bug.
Prune your example until it can be pruned no more without sending the
error into hiding. I prune most error demonstrations to only a few
lines. Annotate your example with C comments that describe the bug and
your suggested fix, if you have one. If the example crashes, please
report the last part of the call chain if you can.

Send your example by electronic mail to cii-bugs@cs.princeton.edu and
to drh@cs.princeton.edu. Please send only valid C programs; put all
remarks in C comments so that I can process reports semiautomatically.
