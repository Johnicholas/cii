<TITLE>Preface for C Interfaces and Implementations</TITLE>
</HEAD> 
<BODY>
<H1>Preface</H1> 
<P>Programmers are inundated with information about application programming
interfaces - APIs. Yet, while most programmers use APIs and the libraries that
implement them in almost every application they write, relatively few create new
APIs. Indeed, programmers seem to prefer to 'roll their own' instead of
searching for a library that might meet their needs, perhaps because it is
easier to write application-specific code than to craft well designed APIs.</P>
<P>I'm as guilty as the next programmer:
<A HREF="http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/lcc/">lcc</A>, a compiler for
ANSI C written by Chris Fraser and myself, was built from the ground up. (<TT>lcc</TT>
is described in C.W. Fraser and D. R. Hanson, <CITE>A Retargetable C Compiler:
Design and Implementation</CITE>, Addison-Wesley, 1995.) A compiler exemplifies
the kind of application for which it possible to use standard interfaces and to
create interfaces that are useful elsewhere. Examples include interfaces for
memory management, string and symbol tables, and list manipulation. But <TT>lcc</TT>
uses only a few routines from the ANSI C library, and almost none of its code
can be used directly in other applications.</P>
<P>This book advocates a design methodology based on <I>interfaces</I> and
their implementations, and it illustrates this methodology by describing 24
interfaces and their implementations in detail. These interfaces span a large
part of the computing spectrum and include data structures, arithmetic, string
processing, and concurrent programming. The implementations aren't toys -
they're designed for use in production code. As described below, the source code
is freely available.</P>
<P>There's little support in the C programming language for the interface-based
design methodology. Object-oriented languages, like C++ and Modula-3, have
language features that encourage the separation of an interface from its
implementation. Interface-based design is independent of any particular
language, but it does require more programmer will power and vigilance in
languages like C, because it's too easy to pollute an interface with implicit
knowledge of its implementation and vice versa.</P>
<P>Once mastered, however, interface-based design can speed development time by
building upon a foundation of general-purpose interfaces that can serve many
applications. The 'foundation class' libraries in some C++ environments are
examples of this effect. Increased reuse of existing software - libraries of
interface implementations - reduces initial development costs. It also reduces
maintenance costs, because more of an application rests on well tested
implementations of general-purpose interfaces.</P>
<P>The interfaces come from several sources, and all have been revised for this
book. Some of the interfaces for data structures - abstract data types -
originated in <TT>lcc</TT>'s code, and in early implementations of the
<A HREF="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/www/">Icon programming language</A> (R.
E. Griswold and M. T. Griswold, <CITE>The Icon Programming Language</CITE>,
Prentice Hall, 1990), which were done in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Others
come from the published work of others; the Further Reading sections at the end
of each chapter give the details.</P>
<P>Some of the interfaces are for data structures, but this is not a data
structures book, per se. The emphasis is more on 'algorithm engineering' -
packaging data structures for general use in applications - than on data
structure algorithms. Good interface design does rely on using appropriate data
structures and efficient algorithms, however, and this thus complements
traditional data structure and algorithms texts, such as Robert Sedgewick's
<CITE>Algorithms in C</CITE> (Addison-Wesley, 1990).</P>
<P>Most chapters describe one interface and its implementation; a few chapters
describe a few related interfaces. The Interface section in each chapter gives a
concise, detailed description of just the interface. For programmers interested
only in using the interfaces, these sections form a reference manual for their
interfaces. A few chapters include Examples sections, which illustrate the use
of one or more interfaces in simple applications.</P>
<P>The Implementation section in each chapter is a detailed tour of the code
that implements the chapter's interface. In a few cases, more than one
implementation for the same interface is described, which illustrates an
advantage of interface-based design. These sections are most useful for those
modifying or extending an interface or designing related interfaces. Many of the
exercises explore design and implementation alternatives. It should not be
necessary to read an Implementation section in order to understand how to use an
interface.</P>
<P>The interfaces, examples, and implementations are presented as 'literate
programs.' The source code is interleaved with its explanation in an order that
best suits understanding the code. The code is extracted automatically from the
text files for this book and assembled into the order dictated by the C
programming language. Other book-length examples of literate programming in C
include
<CITE>A Retargetable C Compiler</CITE> and <CITE>The Stanford GraphBase: A
Platform for Combinatorial Computing</CITE> by D. E. Knuth (Addison-Wesley,
1993).</P>
<P>Most readers will benefit from reading all of Chapters 1-4, because these
chapters form the framework for the rest of the book. The remaining chapters can
be read in any order, although some of the later chapters refer to their
predecessors.</P>
<P>Chapter 1 covers literate programming and issues of programming style and
efficiency. Chapter 2 motivates and describes the interface-based design
methodology, defines the relevant terminology, and tours two simple interfaces
and their implementations. Chapter 3 describes the prototypical <TT>Atom</TT>
interface, which is the simplest, production-quality interface in this book.
Chapter 4 introduces exceptions and assertions, which are used in every
interface.</P>
<P>I assume that readers understand C at the level covered in college-level
introductory programming courses, and have a working understanding of
fundamental data structures at the level presented in texts like <CITE>Algorithms
in C</CITE>. At Princeton, the material in this book is used in systems
programming courses from the sophomore to first-year graduate levels. Many of
the interfaces use 'advanced' C programming techniques, such as opaque pointers
and pointers to pointers, and thus serve as nontrivial examples of those
techniques, which are useful in systems programming and data structure courses.</P>
<P>This book can be used for courses in several ways. The simplest way is for
students to just use the interfaces in project-oriented courses. In a compiler
course, for example, students often build a compiler for a toy language, and
substantial projects are common in graphics courses. Many of the interfaces can
simplify the projects in these kinds of courses by eliminating some of the grunt
programming needed to get such projects off the ground. This usage helps
students realize the enormous savings that reuse can bring to a project, and it
often induces them to try interface-based design for their own parts of the
project. This latter effect is particularly valuable in team projects, because
that's a way of life in the 'real world.'</P>
<P>Interfaces and implementations are the focus of Princeton's sophomore-level
systems programming course. Assignments require students to be interface
clients, implementors, and designers. In one assignment, for example, I
distribute Section 8.1's <TT>Table</TT> interface, the object code for its
implementation, and the specifications for Section 8.2's word frequency program,
<TT>wf</TT>. The students must implement wf using only my object code for <TT>Table</TT>.
In the next assignment, they get the object code for <TT>wf</TT>, and they must
implement <TT>Table</TT>. Sometimes, I reverse these assignments, but both
orders are eye-openers for most students. They are unaccustomed to having only
object code for major parts of their program, and these assignments are usually
their first exposure to the semi-formal notation used in interfaces and program
specification.</P>
<P>Initial assignments also introduce checked runtime errors and assertions as
integral parts of interface specifications. Again, it takes a few assignments
before students begin to appreciate the value of these concepts. I forbid
'unannounced' crashes; that is, crashes that are not announced by an assertion
failure diagnostic. Programs that crash get a grade of zero. This penalty may
seem unduly harsh, but it gets the students' attention. They also gain an
appreciation of the advantages of safe languages, like ML and Modula-3, in which
unannounced crashes are impossible. (This grading policy is less harsh than it
sounds, because in multi-part assignments, only the offending part is penalized
and different assignments have different weights. I've given many zeros, but
none has ever caused a course grade to shift by a whole point.)</P>
<P>Once students have a few interfaces under their belts, later assignments ask
them to design new interfaces and to live with their design choices. For
example, one of Andrew Appel's favorite assignments is a primality testing
program. Students work in groups to design the interfaces for the arbitrary
precision arithmetic that is needed for this assignments. The results are
similar to the interfaces in Chapters 17-19. Different groups design interfaces,
and a post-assignment comparison of these interfaces, in which the groups
critique each other's work, is always quite revealing. Kai Li accomplishes
similar goals with a semester-long group project that builds an X-based editor
using the <A HREF="http://www.sunlabs.com/research/tcl/">Tcl/Tk system</A> (J.
K. Ousterhout, <CITE>Tcl and the Tk Toolkit</CITE>, Addison-Wesley, 1994) and
editor-specific interfaces designed and implemented by the students. Tk itself
provides another good example of interface-based design.</P>
<P>In advanced courses, I usually package assignments as interfaces and give
the students free reign to revise them and to improve them, and to even to
change the goals of the assignment. Giving them a starting point reduces the
time required for assignment, and allowing substantial changes encourages
creative students to explore alternatives. The unsuccessful alternatives are
often more educational that the successful ones. Students invariably go down the
wrong road, and they pay for it with greatly increased development time. When,
in hindsight, they understand their mistakes, they come to appreciate that
designing good interfaces is hard, but worth the effort, and they almost always
become converts to interface-based design.</P>

<H2>Acknowledgments</H2> 
<P>I've been using some of the interfaces in this book for my own research
project and in courses at the University of Arizona and Princeton University
since the late-1970s. Students in these courses have been guinea pigs for my
drafts of these interfaces. Their feedback over the years has been an important
contribution to both the code in this book and to its explanation. The Princeton
students in several offerings of CS 217 and CS 596 deserve special thanks,
because they suffered unknowingly through the drafts of most of what's in this
book.</P>
<P>Interfaces are a way of life at Digital's System Research Center (SRC), and
my 1992 and 1993 summers at SRC working on the Modula-3 project erased any
doubts I may have harbored about the efficacy of this approach. My thanks to Bob
Taylor, SRC's Director, for supporting my visits, and to Bill Kalsow, Eric
Muller, and Greg Nelson for many illuminating discussions.</P>
<P>Technical interactions with colleagues and students have contributed to this
book in many ways. Even seemingly unrelated discussions have provoked
improvements in my code and in its explanation. Those who deserve explicit
thanks include Andrew Appel, Jack Davidson, John Ellis, Mary Fern&aacute;ndez,
Chris Fraser, Brian Kernighan, Kai Li, Rob Pike, Norman Ramsey, John Reppy, Anne
Rogers, and
