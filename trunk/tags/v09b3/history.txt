This beta release is the last one before release 1.0, which will coincide
with the publication of C Interfaces and Implementations in August 1996.

There are too many bug fixes to list individually here, so the following
summary describes only the interface changes and the new examples.

cref/*.c:
     A version of xref that uses Text and Ring.

iref/*.c:
     A version of xref that uses Text, Array, and MP.

idents/*.c:
     A version of ids that uses Str and Seq.

kref/*.c:
     A version of xref that uses Str and Seq.

words/*.c:
     A version of ids that uses Text and Ring.

src/bit.h:
     Renamed Bit_length to Bit_count, Bit_size to Bit_length, Bit_member to
     Bit_get, and removed Bit_remove.
     Removed Bit_remove.
     Changed Bit_put to Bit_put(set, n, bit), which now sets bit n in set
     to bit and returns the previous value of bit n.
src/except.h:
     Added enumeration identifiers for the values assigned to Except_flag.
src/ring.h:
     Changed Ring_put(ring, i, x) so it returns the previous value of
     ring[i] instead of x.
src/seq.h:
     Changed Seq_put(seq, i, x) so it returns the previous value of seq[i]
     instead of x.
src/set.h:
     Renamed Set_cvt to Set_fmt.
src/str.h:
     Renamed Str_cvt to Str_fmt.
src/table.h:
     Changed Table_put(table, key, value) so it returns the previous value
     associated with key instead of value, or null if table doesn't hold
     key.
src/text.h:
     Changed the str field in Text_T to const char *str.
     Renamed Text_cvt to Text_fmt.
src/xp.h:
     Changed the return type of XP_add, XP_sub, XP_sum, XP_diff,
     XP_product, XP_quotient, and XP_neg, and XP_fromstr to int, and
     changed the type of the last argument (carry, borrow, or y) to these
     functions to int.
     Changed the return type of XP_fromstr to int.
     Changed the prototype of XP_mul to int XP_mul(T z, int n, T x, int m,
     T y) so n and m precede the T values to which they apply.
     Changed the prototype of XP_div to int XP_div(int n, T q, T x, int m,
     T y, T r, T tmp) so n and m precede the T values to which they apply .
     Changed the type of the last argument (fill) to XP_lshift and
     XP_lshift to int.

`const' qualifiers have been added to some of the arguments in many of the
interfaces. The source files have been stamped with an RCS-like revision
numbers. C++ keywords are no longer used as variables.

calc/calc.c:
     Changed the negation operator _ to ~.

mpcalc/mpcalc.c:
     Changed the negation and complement operators, _ and ~, to ~ and !.

src/atom.h:
     Atom_new now accepts zero-length strings.
src/atom.c:
     Changed Atom_new to accept len=0.
src/bit.h:
     Removed Bit_cmp.
     Added Bit_eq, Bit_leq, and Bit_lt.
src/bit.c:
     Changed internal representation to avoid the `struct hack,' removed
     Bit_cmp, and added implementations for Bit_eq, Bit_leq, and Bit_lt.
src/except.h:
     Removed RETURN_VOID and changed the definition of RETURN so that it
     subsumes RETURN_VOID.
src/ring.c:
     Fixed Ring_rotate so that Ring_rotate(r, 0) when r is empty works.
src/set.h:
     The cmp(x,y) function passed to Set_new must now return an integer <0,
     =0, or >0 if x<y, x=y, or x>y.
src/str.c:
     Fixed incorrect arguments to va_start in Str_catv.
src/swtch.s:
     Added support for the DEC Alpha.
src/table.h:
     The cmp(x,y) function passed to Table_new must now return an integer
     <0, =0, or >0 if x<y, x=y, or x>y.
src/table.c:
     Fixed incorrect comparison in Table_remove that caused entries not to
     be removed.
src/thread.h:
     Added Thread_Failed; Thread_new raises Thread_Failed when it cannot
     create a thread, instead of Mem_Failed.
src/thread.c:
     Fixed incorrect arguments to memset in Thread_new, and changed
     Thread_new to raise Thread_Failed.
     Added support for the DEC Alpha to Thread_new.
