`const' qualifiers have been added to some of the arguments in many of the
interfaces. The source files have been stamped with an RCS-like revision
numbers. C++ keywords are no longer used as variables.

calc/calc.c:
     Changed the negation operator _ to ~.

mpcalc/mpcalc.c:
     Changed the negation and complement operators,_ and ~, to ~ and !.

src/atom.h:
     Atom_new now accepts zero-length strings.
src/atom.c:
     Changed Atom_new to accept len=0.
src/bit.h:
     Removed Bit_cmp.
     Added Bit_eq, Bit_leq, and Bit_lt.
src/bit.c:
     Changed internal representation to avoid the `struct hack', removed
     Bit_cmp, and added implementations for Bit_eq, Bit_leq, and Bit_lt.
src/except.h:
     Removed RETURN_VOID and changed the definition of RETURN so that it
     subsumes RETURN_VOID.
src/ring.c:
     Fixed Ring_rotate so that Ring_rotate(r, 0) when r is empty works.
src/set.h:
     The cmp(x,y) function passed to Set_new must now return an integer <0,
     =0, or >0 if x<y, x=y, or x>y.
src/str.c:
     Fixed incorrect arguments to va_start in Str_catv.
src/swtch.s:
     Added support for the DEC Alpha.
src/table.h:
     The cmp(x,y) function passed to Table_new must now return an integer
     <0, =0, or >0 if x<y, x=y, or x>y.
src/table.c:
     Fixed incorrect comparison in Table_remove that caused entries not to
     be removed.
src/thread.h:
     Added Thread_Failed; Thread_new raises Thread_Failed when it cannot
     create a thread, instead of Mem_Failed.
src/thread.c:
     Fixed incorrect arguments to memset in Thread_new, and changed
     Thread_new to raise Thread_Failed.
     Added support for the DEC Alpha to Thread_new.
